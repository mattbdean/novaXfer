novaXfer is a tool to help students at the Northern Virginia Community College plan their classes by showing them what will and what will not transfer to a four year institution.

For a list of supported colleges, see [here](https://github.com/mattbdean/novaXfer/tree/master/server/src/indexers).

novaXfer is built with Node.js, MongoDB, Express, TypeScript, Angular, Gulp, Webpack, and several other buzzwords.

Getting started is simple. Run MongoDB on the default port and execute

```shell
$ yarn install && gulp
```
